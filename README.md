# Advent Of Code 2020
## Dart Edition
---

## What This Is
Dart implementation of [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

## How to use
Each file is a separate, isolated implementation of each day's two part question. Each day is denoted by the filename, `day_n`; each part denoted by `_a` or `_b`. 

With [Dart](https://dart.dev) installed, simply `dart <file>` for the runtime experience.

## About The Code
It's actually pretty simple, and as of yet, does not use much dart-specific concepts. But, it's a great example of how simple dart can be to get the hang of.

I'm still new to the language; this is my exploration into what can be done.
